# Cross-Carousel with lit-element

Experimenting with lit-element.

This is a pretty boring carousel that 'splits' on slide change with each piece of the slide in a different direction. I didn't hook up directionality so they all move the same direction. 

JS code is heavily commented and all the interesting stuff happens there.
