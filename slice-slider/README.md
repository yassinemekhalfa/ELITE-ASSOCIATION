# Slice Slider

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/StephenScaff/pen/egOedp](https://codepen.io/StephenScaff/pen/egOedp).

A little slicey transition slider using  a simple add class deal.

Wanted to see if I could get this interaction butter smooth, with just css transitions, as oppose to a animation lib like Velocity or GSAP.

Have to smooth out the timings a bit and decide on the best approach for mobile (just stack, add touch events, make images full viewport, etc.

Supports scrollwheel (scroll jacking), nav buttons and arrow keys.

Can also increase the content wrapper to make the images fill viewport in their non animating state, which is kinda cool as well.
